### :two: `HOW TO RUN`
### ⚠️ `NOTICE`
- IN ORDER TO RUN THIS APP YOU MUST REGISTER AN API_KEY. ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
  - You can find the API here:  [ASOS API](https://rapidapi.com/search/Asos) 
   - In order to `use the API` you have to `REGISTER`
   - then you have to `subscribe to the API` ( There is a `free version` that grants you 500 requests)
   - add the API KEY to `productFetch.ts Hook` under `X-RapidAPI-Key`
   
- THE **FREE VERSION** OF THIS API HAS ONLY `500` REQUESTS PER DAY!
- THE API MIGHT BE SLOW!
- The API is massive, so only a portion of the data is used. But all the types for these end points are declared: 
  - categories/list
  - products/v2/list
